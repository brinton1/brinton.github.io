    <h2>Football Rules You Probably Didn’t Know</h2>
    <p>Imagine stepping onto a football pitch. You feel the roar of the crowd, the thrill of the game… but beneath all the goals, passes, and tackles, there’s a hidden layer — a set of rules most fans have never noticed, rules that change how the game really works.</p>

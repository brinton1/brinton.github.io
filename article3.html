    <h2>Football Rules You Probably Didn’t Know</h2>
    <p>Imagine stepping onto a football pitch. You feel the roar of the crowd, the thrill of the game… but beneath all the goals, passes, and tackles, there’s a hidden layer — a set of rules most fans have never noticed, rules that change how the game really works.</p>

    <p>1. Goal Can Be Awarded Without Ball Entering the Net

If a referee stops play for an offense inside the goal area but had clearly prevented a certain goal, they can award a goal directly. This almost never happens in modern professional football but is technically in the Laws of the Game.</p>
    <p>2. Goalkeepers Can Be Penalized for Overstepping During a Throw

Goalkeepers sometimes think they can throw the ball from anywhere, but if the throw crosses the penalty area line improperly or they overstep the line, it’s an indirect free kick for the opposing team. Rarely enforced because referees usually ignore subtle foot errors.</p>
   <p>3. Free Kick Can Be Taken from Anywhere Behind the Ball

Law 13 states that for indirect or direct free kicks, the ball can be moved backward before the kick is taken, as long as the kick is taken from the same spot relative to where the foul occurred. Most players don’t know this, and referees rarely enforce it because it’s unusual in fast play.</p>
   <p>4. Double Punishment Avoidance Rule

If a player commits an offense inside their own penalty area that is also punishable by a card, the referee can choose either a penalty or a caution—but not both for the same offense. This is rarely applied because referees often default to caution + penalty automatically.</p>
  <p>5. Throw-Ins Can Be Invalidated If Ball Crosses Outside Touchline Mid-Arc

If a throw-in re-enters play after curving in the air but crosses outside the touchline before landing, it counts as out of bounds, even if it lands in the field. Most referees never notice this subtlety; it’s one of the strangest technicalities in football.</p>

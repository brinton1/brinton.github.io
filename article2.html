    <h2>Top 10 Heartbreaking Moments in Football</h2>
    <p>Football isn’t just a game—it’s a saga of passion, dreams, and sometimes heartbreak. Here are ten moments that left fans around the world in tears:</p>

    In 1964, during a match in Peru between Alianza Lima and Atlético Torino, a sudden stadium collapse killed hundreds of fans, leaving chaos, screams, and grief in the stands. It remains one of football’s deadliest tragedies, a stark reminder that the beautiful game can turn horrifyingly fatal.

The 1971 Ibrox Disaster in Glasgow saw 66 Rangers fans crushed to death when a stairway collapsed after a match. The stadium turned into a scene of panic and tears, and the catastrophe deeply scarred Scottish football. Families mourned loved ones, and players witnessed the horror unfolding in front of them.

In 1985, during the European Cup final at Heysel Stadium in Belgium, 39 Juventus fans were killed and hundreds injured due to rioting and a stadium wall collapse. The tragedy, caused by fan violence and poor safety, left players and spectators traumatized. UEFA imposed a ban on English clubs, and the image of grieving fans haunted football for decades.

In 1990, Marc-Vivien Foé, a talented Cameroonian midfielder, collapsed and died on the pitch during a FIFA Confederations Cup match. Teammates and opponents tried desperately to save him, but the stadium fell silent as tragedy struck live in front of millions of viewers. His death remains one of football’s most shocking on-field catastrophes.

During the 2001 Accra Stadium disaster in Ghana, 125 fans died in a stampede when police fired tear gas to control crowd unrest during a match. The screams and chaos were broadcast widely, leaving players, fans, and the nation in deep mourning. The incident highlighted the deadly consequences of overcrowding and poor crowd management.

The 2012 Port Said Stadium riot in Egypt claimed the lives of 74 fans after clashes between rival supporters and security forces. Scenes of death, injury, and mourning filled the streets. Players could hardly continue the match, and the catastrophe sent shockwaves through Egyptian football.

In 2014, a tragic moment struck during a match in Bolivia when a fan fell from a stadium railing during celebrations, resulting in death. Other fans wept openly in the stands, turning a moment of joy into sheer heartbreak.

The 2017 Chapecoense plane crash is one of football’s most catastrophic tragedies. On the way to the Copa Sudamericana final, the Brazilian team’s plane crashed, killing 71 people, including players, staff, and journalists. Teammates, families, and fans around the world wept in disbelief. Memorials and tributes poured in globally, marking it as a disaster far beyond the pitch.
